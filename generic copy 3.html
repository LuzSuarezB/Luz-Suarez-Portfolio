						<h3>Haitian Revolution In Cuba</h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Haiti and Cuba.jpg" alt="" /></span>CSI 274 - Cuba: Nation, Race, Revolution: When we think of Cuba, the first thing that may come to mind is communism and all the agenda that the United States has made sure is implemented in our brains. Even though Haiti and Cuba are neighboring Islands, for some reason, I personally never thought of them as having a historical relation; it could not be more far from reality. Throughout this course, we learned about Cuba's complicated history and how it is so uniquely shaped. There have been multiple historical remarks that have impacted and shaped Cuba into what it is today. For my final research paper for this course, I explored how the Haitian revolution had a tremendously massive impact on the revolution that its citizens had when they were “taking back" their country. 						.</p>

					<h3>Dominican Immigrants: Their Positive Impact on the US</h3>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="Little Dominican.jpg" alt="" /></span> GOV 307: Topics in American Government: Latinos and the Politics of Immigration in the U.S.: Western countries have a tendency to describe their immigrants that come from underdeveloped countries with derogatory and discriminatory terms in the United States is not strange to that. The United States, governmental characters, and others in power love to talk about how Mexicans (because, in their mind, all Latino immigrants are Mexicans) come to this country to fill it with crime and drugs and that the migrants come to steal their ‘American’ jobs. They speak as if there is no positive impact or contribution that the Mexicans could add to this country whatsoever. In the final project, I bring a not new, but unfortunately, not the common idea that there are multiple positive impacts that Latino immigrants have on this country, both economically and culturally. I explored the sense of belonging and who deserves to be here. I mainly focus on the positive impact of Dominican immigrants on the United States culture, specifically in Washington Heights, a neighborhood in New York known for its large population of Dominican immigrants of all generations.
