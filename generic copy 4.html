						<h3>The Haudenosaunee Confederacy</h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Haudenosaunee Confederacy.jpg" alt="" /></span>CSI-0243: Indigenous Perspectives on U.S. History: I took this course because even though I am very familiar with colonization in the Caribbean and Latin America, I did not know much about colonization in the upper side of North America. This course helped me learn exactly that, and I like that it was from the right side of history. I was terrified of learning about colonization through a wrong perspective and or deceitful one; however, learning from an Indigenous perspective helped me understand current relations and situations much better. For the final project of this course, we were supposed to propose a research project that we would do if we were to, hypothetically, continue a second semester in the class. For my proposal, I chose to research the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, and some of the topics I would've researched would have been their family structure, documentation committee, institutes, and migration policies. 						.</p>

					<h3>Learning with Culture Podcast: Bartolomé de las Casas</h3>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="Bartolome 2.jpg" alt="" /></span> LAS301iw-01: Topics in Latin American and Latino/a Studies-Colonial and Postcolonial Indigenous Worlds: Similar to CSI-0243: Indigenous perspective in US history, and this course we were learning about in indigeneity and colonial history, but in Latin America, and through the lenses of different books written chiefly by Latin American authors. The class was mainly focused on discussions about topics related to the books and any questions or arguments that could come up during class time. For my final project, I recorded a podcast based on the life of Bartolomé de La Casas, who was a Spaniard Dominico, who, even though his primary purpose was to teach Christianity and its values to the indigenous people in the Americas, and eventually convert them, he became a pioneer in the advocacy for the lives on the indigenous people by being the first one to speak up about the atrocities that the colonizers/settlers we're committing Latin America. In my podcast, I do biography research on his early life, his educational journey, and the different types of encounters, struggles, and fights as an advocate for Indigenous people.</p>
