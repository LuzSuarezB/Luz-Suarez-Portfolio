							<h2>Orientation Leader - F22 ~ F23</h2>
							<p>For the Fall of 2022, I was part of the New and Transfer Students Orientation Program as an orientation leader. This was my first time participating in this role, and I encountered multiple challenges. The goal of this role was to welcome the new and transfer students arriving that semester, engage with them through various activities, and be present for support in the info panels they had to attend. The training for the role was extensive and tiring; therefore, during the actual orientation, we (the other OLs I was working with and I) were stressed, nervous, and exhausted. One of my biggest challenges was coming out of my comfort zone, engaging with students who had very different backgrounds than me, and being their ‘leader.’ At the moment, I was still timid and intimidated by the ‘college life’ and the standards of being a college student. By the end of the program, not only had I learned new things about Hampshire, but I had also developed new social, engaging, and management skills. I also gained more confidence to put myself out there and try new things. Lastly, I also lost my fear of being and looking different from those surrounding me. From that experience, I gained the skills and the confidence to work with a large group of people from various cultures, places, and backgrounds. 
							<p>In the Fall of 2023, I was once again an orientation leader in the New and Transfer Students Orientation Program. This was my second time participating in this role, and the experience was very different from the first. Both the training and the program ran much more smoothly. My abilities to multitask, lead, resolve conflict, and solve problems evolved significantly. Thanks to these experiences, I am more capable of working with different types of people and communities, whether it is social work, community involvement, or a research study. </p>
							<h2>Student Advocacy Board - Student Life Representative</h2>
							<p>For the school year F23 - F24, I was (and still am for the current year) elected as the Student Advocacy Board (SAB) Student Life Representative. The SAB is the version of a student government at Hampshire College. Still, instead of a hierarchical system (president, vice president, etc.), we have a ‘wheel’ system, in which there are 7 ‘departments,’ each with different sectors to cover. Each department has a Student Representative, and 4 have Team Members. My department was Student Life, which covered resident halls, mods, transfer students, commuter students, non-traditional students, and other issues related to students living on and off campus. As a whole, SAB had many accomplishments last year, some of which are still in the works. One accomplishment that my department had was the installation of 8 water stations throughout the Dakin Residential Dorms so that the students wouldn't have to go to the bathroom to get water. Another accomplishment we had was successfully meeting with facilities to ensure that the conditions of on-campus student residences were clean and decent when students returned from summer break, which improvements were noticed this time. Lastly, we also met with the Housing office multiple times to work together to ensure that students’ needs were met. This position helped me better understand how institutions can work within departments to meet common goals.</p>
