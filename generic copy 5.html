						<h3>Opresor que se victimizaPO</h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Power Dynamics.jpg" alt="" /></span>SPN260mr-01: Topics in Latin American Cultural History-Modernization and Resistance: Even though I was born and raised in the Dominican Republic, came to the United States at the age of 14, and had my chance to experience the education system in my country, I felt as if I was missing something. Therefore, I decided to take a Spanish course in college so I wouldn’t feel like I missed out on the opportunity. Even though this course was about Latin America, which I focused my studies on a lot, the focus was a lot on media film and production; however, since it was through a historical lens, I was able to not only learn a lot but find ways to connect it to my Divisial work. For the final project, I wrote an essay exploring how, most commonly, in the post-colonial period, many European descent white writers found a way to victimize themselves and try to transmit some pity to their readers. Even though these were people who were highly privileged in their times, they still found a way to feel inferior and as if they were struggling compared to the people who were Indigenous and of Afro descent. We're the ones who were genuinely suffering and struggling—the audacity. I criticized and called out their hypocrisy and connected it to how politicians and public figures use this type of language to cause sympathy in the pueblo and get more votes. 						.</p>

					<h3>Learning Something New</h3>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="Potuguês.jpg" alt="" /></span> POR125: Português para Falantes de Espanhol & POR215-01: Portuguese Conversation and Composition: when we speak of Latin America, commonly the countries that are either talked about or given a thought about tend to be Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Puerto Rico, or any other Hispanic Latin American country. We tend to live aside Haiti and Brazil, which have significantly influenced Latin America's politics, economy, and culture because their official language is not Spanish. In the course that I took in the fall of 2022 called Cuba, I learned a lot about Haiti. Its revolutionary history and vast cultural impact on the rest of the Americas was the first Latin American country to be declared independent. However, I didn't know much about Brazil. 
						For this reason, I took two courses over the payment of two semesters to not only learn Portuguese but also to get a better grasp of their culture, their ways, their customs, and even some political positions. Even though my final projects were vague in the topics mentioned before, they were the boost I needed to start my journey to learn about this beautiful country.</p>
